# Web Courses prototype
Prototype of the Reactor Lab desktop software 

Files with the file name extension .rev are LiveCode files. Revolution (.rev) was the previous name of LiveCode. See LiveCode at [livecode.com](https://livecode.com). LiveCode, as of 2022, can open .rev files. 

This project was developed for the SRC Engineering Research Center for Environmentally Benign Semiconductor Manufacturing (ERC) at [www.erc.arizona.edu](http://www.erc.arizona.edu) by Richard K. Herz in 2003. 

It's goal was to demonstrate the ability of desktop software to access and run interactive lab modules from the Internet.

That capability was integrated into Reactor Lab in 2003. See the Reactor Lab project here on GitHub.
